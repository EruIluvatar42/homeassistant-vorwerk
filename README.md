This fork is primarily meant for my own personal use to keep this integration functioning for my VR200. I do not plan to do any development above that.
Currently the integrations works with Home Assistant 2025.12
If this is helpfull to you, please feel free to download and use.

## homeassistant-vorwerk

Home assistant integration to control Vorwerk VR vacuum cleaners.

With the new Vorwerk App and authentication the Home Assistant Neato component dropped the vorwerk support. This integration is based on the neato component with the new Vorwerk authentication flow.

## Supported vacuum cleaners

- VR200
- VR300 (without map sensors)

## Installation

 Use HACS or checkout this repository and copy the `custom_components/vorwerk` folder in your home assistant configuration under: `<HA config directory>/custom_components/<domain>`
